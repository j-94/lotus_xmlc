The prompts act as instructions that guide the model.\\nAdapter Modules: These are small neural networks added to specific layers of the LLM that adapt it to new data/tasks. Only the adapter module parameters are updated during training on new data, not the whole LLM.\\nRetrieval Augmentation: The LLM is combined with an external knowledge source like a database. The database stores facts and texts on new topics. The LLM can then leverage this information when generating text via queries made to the database.\\nContinual Pre-training: New data is periodically used to continue the pre-training phase of model development, as opposed to fine-tuning on specialized datasets. This aims to expand the breadth of knowledge while maintaining performance on previously learned concepts.\\nKnowledge Distillation: The knowledge from a large trained model is transferred to a smaller model for efficiency. The smaller model learns by trying to mimic the outputs of the larger model on new data, instead of the actual labels.\\nFrozen LLM + Learned Prompts: The LLM weights remain frozen, and only a small set of prompt embeddings are learned for new concepts. The prompts provide a context that guides the frozen LLM.\\nIn summary, techniques like prompt engineering and adapter modules allow new capabilities to be added to LLMs without interfering with or overwriting previously learned knowledge through invasive fine-tuning. They aim to expand what the LLM can do while maintaining its foundation.\", \"note\": \"\", \"created\": \"2023-10-22T19:09:32.914Z\", \"lastUpdate\": \"2023-10-22T19:09:32.914Z\", \"creatorRef\": 1458823, \"_id\": \"6535736c142529d6cf098847\"}], \"favorite\": false}", "id": 999819695}
